# AI Agent Oracle Network (POC)

This repository contains the **theoretical proof-of-concept (POC)** for a decentralized oracle layer designed to connect smart contracts with AI agent-driven systems.

> **Disclaimer:** This project is currently a research-oriented POC. The implementation is not production-ready and should **not** be used as a live product.

---

## **Overview**

Modern blockchain ecosystems lack standardized, verifiable methods for interacting with AI agents deployed off-chain. This POC proposes an oracle architecture that:

- Bridges smart contracts with heterogeneous AI agents (TEE-enabled, cloud, or user-deployed).
- Enables verifiable responses from AI agents to on-chain requests.
- Supports scalable, event-driven workflows through distributed orchestrators.

The focus of this POC is on **conceptual design and architecture**, providing a framework for future implementation.

## **Key Components**

1. **Oracle Layer for Agent Systems**
   - Bridges smart contracts and AI agents.
   - Routes requests and verifies signed responses.

2. **Distributed Orchestrators**
   - Assign AI tasks efficiently across multiple validators.
   - Track agent availability and trust.

3. **TEE-Enabled Agent Runtime**
   - Optional official runtime using Phala or similar TEEs for secure and verifiable execution.

4. **User-Agent Integration**
   - Users can connect their own AI agents to the oracle while maintaining verifiable responses.

5. **High-Throughput Event Handling**
   - Scalable event propagation and queues to handle hundreds of requests per second.

## **Project Status**

- **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**: Architectural design completed.
- **Implementation**: Not yet implemented. No working code or deployment is provided.
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate feasibility and system design for research and academic evaluation.

## **Future Work**

- Implement the TEE-enabled agent runtime.
- Build distributed orchestrators for scalable task assignment.
- Enable integration for user-deployed AI agents.
- Anchor agent response verification and reputation on-chain.
- Develop high-throughput event propagation and queueing infrastructure.
